        When run for the first time, two files should be created: 1 account database and 1 wealth database.
        Running a 2nd+ time will only create additional wealth databases. Additionally the builder will 
        contain the setup required for the accounts table (i.e., names)

        Nb. There can be a maximum of 4 wealth databases.
