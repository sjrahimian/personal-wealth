### Longer Descrition

_Personal Wealth Mirror_ is a tool to assist an individual in reflecting on personal wealth by categorizing purchases as a "need" or a "want". In this manner, the hope is a deeper analysis of our matericalistic world.

What comes to mind when you hear the word "materialism"? Do objects such as cars, jeweleray, mansions, clothes, toys, televisions, and boats come to mind? Is it wrong to own cars and televisions, or having good income? Before going any further let's quickly define "materialism". According to the dictionary it is:

1. a tendency to consider material possessions and physical comfort as more important than spiritual values. 
       "they hated the sinful materialism of the wicked city"
2. Philosophy - the doctrine that nothing exists except matter and its movements and modifications. The doctrine that consciousness and will are wholly due to material agency.

While this applicaiton may focus on the the first definition by and large, understanding that the former is one form or manifestation of the second definition is important to keep in mind at all times. In this manner, both definitons help modulate one another, as one can be conceptualized as breadth while the other is depth, and goes to show that owning "material" objects is not a "_bad thing_" in and of itself. Materialism becomes a problem when the divides between wealth and poverty grow extermely wide (as exists today), or impulse shopping takes hold (as trained in to the consumer from infanthood almost), or when one lacks moderation in life; of course, this is a short list, and not everything on this lists can be handled by this simple application.

It is important however to start somewhere, and the begins with the one becoming concious of spending habits by creating a dicotomy between "want" and "need". To that end, the point of the application is not to dictate what is and is not a "want", and likewise for "need". That is for the individual user (you) to figure out. E.g., you may categorize buying chips as a need, whereas someone else may categorize it as a "want", and still another will categorize is as a "need" when buying for a shindig, but "want" all other times. The point is not neccessarily the category or categorizing correctly _per se_ either (your views may shift over time), but rather asking "why am I categorizing this object the way I am" or "does it make sense to place this item into this category?"
